    <string name="about_me">An Android Developer is a Software Developer who specializes in designing applications for the Android marketplace. The Android marketplace is the direct competitor to Apple’s app store. This means most of an Android Developer’s job revolves around creating the apps we use on our smartphones and tablets. Android Developers can either work in-house for a large organization, or they can be employed by an App Development agency.</string>

    <string name="large_text" formatted="false">Google LLC is an American multinational technology company that specializes
        in Internet-related services and products, which include online advertising technologies, a search
        engine, cloud computing, software, and hardware. It is considered one of the Big Five companies in
        the American information technology industry, along with Amazon, Facebook, Apple, and Microsoft.
        Google was founded on September 4, 1998, by Larry Page and Sergey Brin while they were Ph.D. students
        at Stanford University in California. Together they own about 14% of its publicly-listed shares and
        control 56% of the stockholder voting power through super-voting stock. The company went public via
        an initial public offering (IPO) in 2004. In 2015, Google was reorganized as a wholly-owned subsidiary
        of Alphabet Inc.. Google is Alphabet\'s largest subsidiary and is a holding company for Alphabet\'s
        Internet properties and interests. Sundar Pichai was appointed CEO of Google on October 24, 2015,
        replacing Larry Page, who became the CEO of Alphabet. On December 3, 2019, Pichai also became the
        CEO of Alphabet. In 2021, the Alphabet Workers Union was founded, mainly composed of Google employees.
        The company\'s rapid growth since incorporation has included products, acquisitions, and partnerships
        beyond Google\'s core search engine, (Google Search). It offers services designed for work and
        productivity (Google Docs, Google Sheets, and Google Slides), email (Gmail), scheduling and time
        management (Google Calendar), cloud storage (Google Drive), instant messaging and video chat
        (Google Duo, Google Chat, and Google Meet), language translation (Google Translate), mapping and
        navigation (Google Maps, Waze, Google Earth, and Street View), podcast hosting (Google Podcasts),
        video sharing (YouTube), blog publishing (Blogger), note-taking (Google Keep and Jamboard), and photo
        organizing and editing (Google Photos). The company leads the development of the Android mobile
        operating system, the Google Chrome web browser, and Chrome OS (a lightweight, proprietary operating
        system based on the free and open-source Chromium OS operating system). Google has moved increasingly
        into hardware; from 2010 to 2015, it partnered with major electronics manufacturers in the production
        of its Google Nexus devices, and it released multiple hardware products in 2016, including the Google
        Pixel line of smartphones, Google Home smart speaker, Google Wifi mesh wireless router. Google has also
        experimented with becoming an Internet carrier (Google Fiber and Google Fi).Google.com is the most
        visited website worldwide. Several other Google-owned websites also are on the list of most popular
        websites, including YouTube and Blogger.[15] On the list of most valuable brands, Google is ranked
        second by Forbes[16] and fourth by Interbrand.[17] It has received significant criticism involving
        issues such as privacy concerns, tax avoidance, censorship, search neutrality, antitrust and abuse
        of its monopoly position.
