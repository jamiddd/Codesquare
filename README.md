# Collabme

Collabme is a social app that allows you to find new connections, whether you’re looking out for people to collaborate on work posts or to expand your professional network. It is a social approach to finding thousands of people on the other side of the internet to join together and learn new things along the way; be it professional work or fun and creative posts.

## How Does it Work?

Online work is personalized with Collabme. Make purposeful connections with people around you, meet people with similar interests, work on ideas together, and much more.

Let others know what you’re working on and collaborate with them to learn and finish your posts effectively and efficiently. If you are in a position where you do not have anyone to work with, this is the right place for you.

## Explore
Collabme lets you search through thousands of posts made by other users who are looking for people to collaborate with.

## Communicate
Once you’ve found the work for you, chat with your coworkers and build a relationship more than your work. Learn together through sharing your problems and queries regarding your work. We all have those days where we are stuck on a problem alone and the answer is not in Google, right?

## Collaborate
Do you also want to learn through working? We’ve got you covered! Join one of the many posts that you can find in Collabme and get started with your endeavors. Be it building your resume or creating impactful work for society, you can get everything done here.

Hope you find some meaningful connections through our app.
