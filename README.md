# CollabMe

CollabMe is a social app that allows you to find new connections, whether you’re looking out for people to collaborate on work posts or to expand your professional network. It is a social approach to finding thousands of people on the other side of the internet to join together and learn new things along the way; be it professional work or fun and creative posts.

## How Does it Work?

Online work is personalized with Collab Me. Make purposeful connections with people around you, meet people with similar interests, work on ideas together, and much more.

Let others know what you’re working on and collaborate with them to learn and finish your posts effectively and efficiently. If you are in a position where you do not have anyone to work with, this is the right place for you.
